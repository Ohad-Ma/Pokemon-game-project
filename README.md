## About
This project represents a game which based on an **directed weighted graph** with various methods and Dijkstra's 
the shortest path algorithm.  
Methods such as : 
- _Add\remove a vertex on the graph._ 
- _Add an edge by connecting two vertices._ 
- _Check whether vertices has an edge between them or not._  
- _Check whether the graph is a fully connected or not._ 
- _Find **the shortest path** and its **distance** between two vertices by using Dijkstra Algorithm._
- _And much more..._
   (for further explanation of the classes and packages please check the wiki)
  
## The game
The game which being represented in this project played by Agents that walks over an **directed weighted graph**
having a will to catch (or eat) many Pokémons as they can before the times runs out!
 
* Each agent that catch a Pokémon receive a gift of speed boost giving it an advantage on the other agents. 

* The main goal of eating many Pokémons and finding the best route go through achieved by using the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

* 24 different levels based on various directed weighted graphs.

* Some Pokémons can be more valuable than the others.

* The game updated and connected to a game-server which provide us levels and arenas as JSON file

Will they succeed in their job?

***The Pokémons***

- There are two Pokémons:

##Instructions
If you have a git bash installed just write down - 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Ohad-Ma/Ex2.git
```
If not:
press on the download button as a zip

Then go to the folder where you've downloaded all the files via CMD and run this command 
```
java -jar Ex2.jar <User id> <Game level> 
```

And then - run the Ex2.jar file it will open this window:

Where 'USER ID' is the identification number of the person and 'LEVEL' is the level desired
from 0-24.

and then hit the 'START' button
